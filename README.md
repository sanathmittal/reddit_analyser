# Reddit Analyzer – AI-Powered Reddit Insights

## 📌 Project Overview

Reddit Analyzer is a multi-agent AI-powered application that analyzes Reddit data using FastAPI, LangChain, OpenAI's GPT-4o-mini, and ChromaDB. This project fetches Reddit data through the PRAW (Python Reddit API Wrapper), processes it with LLMs, and provides intelligent insights.

Currently, the project has two primary agents:

- **Personality & Interest Analyzer** – Analyzes a user's upvoted posts and subreddit activity.
- **AI-Powered Meme & Viral Content Tracker** – Tracks trending meme posts, subreddits, and users.

This project is designed to be fully customizable, allowing users to plug in their own Reddit credentials and run their own analysis.

## 📌 Agents & How They Work

### 1️⃣ Agent 1: Reddit Personality & Interest Analyzer

This agent analyzes a Reddit user's personality and interests based on:
- ✔️ **Upvoted Posts** – What kind of content the user enjoys.
- ✔️ **Frequent Subreddits** – Communities where the user is most active.
- ✔️ **Diversity of Interests** – Determines if the user is interested in a wide range of topics or specific ones.
- ✔️ **Humorous Personality Summary** – Generates a fun AI-driven summary of the user's Reddit habits.

#### 💡 How It Works:

- Fetches upvoted posts and subreddits using the Reddit API.
- Structures the data and sends it to GPT-4o-mini using LangChain.
- Returns a 6-point analysis in a structured format.

#### 📌 FastAPI Route:

```http
GET /analyze_personality/me?access_token=<Reddit Access Token>
```

Input: Reddit OAuth access token
Output: A text-based personality analysis

### 2️⃣ Agent 2: AI-Powered Meme & Viral Content Tracker

This agent tracks trending memes and viral content on Reddit.

- ✔️ **Tracks Meme Posts** – Fetches trending posts from hot, rising, and top categories.
- ✔️ **Gathers All Metadata** – Includes award count, comment velocity, gilding, stickied status, video content, NSFW flag, flair, and self-text.
- ✔️ **Identifies Trending Meme Subreddits** – Finds subreddits posting viral meme content.
- ✔️ **Analyzes User Profiles** – Identifies users posting viral content.
- ✔️ **Extracts Flair & Tags** – Captures post tags and common flair.
- ✔️ **Historical Analysis** – Estimates meme trends based on past data.

#### 💡 How It Works:

- Fetches trending meme content using PRAW.
- Structures all metadata and converts it into a string format.
- Sends data to GPT-4o-mini via LangChain PromptTemplate.
- Returns an LLM-generated analysis of meme trends.

#### 📌 FastAPI Route:

```http
GET /meme_trends?access_token=<Reddit Access Token>
```

Input: Reddit OAuth access token
Output: AI-generated analysis of trending memes

## 📌 Setup & Installation Guide

### 1️⃣ Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- ✅ Python 3.10+
- ✅ Poetry (for dependency management)
- ✅ Git
- ✅ FastAPI & Uvicorn

### 2️⃣ Clone the Repository

Run the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/reddit-analyzer.git
cd reddit-analyzer
```

### 3️⃣ Install Dependencies

We are using Poetry for package management. Run:

```bash
poetry install
```

If you don't have Poetry, install it first:

```bash
pip install poetry
```

### 4️⃣ Set Up Your Reddit API Credentials

Since we use the Reddit API (PRAW), you need to create a Reddit app and obtain API credentials.

#### 📌 Steps to Create a Reddit App:
1. Go to Reddit Developer Portal.
2. Click "Create App".
3. Choose "script" as the app type.
4. Fill in:
   - Name: Any name you want
   - Redirect URI: http://localhost:8000/
   - Permissions: Select all required scopes
5. Click Create App.
6. Copy your Client ID and Client Secret.

### 5️⃣ Configure .env File

Inside your project, create a .env file and store your credentials:

```ini
REDDIT_CLIENT_ID="your-client-id"
REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET="your-client-secret"
REDDIT_USER_AGENT="your-app-name"
OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key"
```

### 6️⃣ Run the FastAPI Server

Start the application:

```bash
poetry run uvicorn main:app --reload
```

The API will be available at:

```
http://127.0.0.1:8000
```
